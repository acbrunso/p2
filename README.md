## Description
This is project 2 which is used to allow users to select an xkdc style
random password.  There can be up to 3 words, 3 special characters, and
3 numbers.

## Details for teaching team
No login required
Nothing special here

##Outside code
There are no external libraries or packages.  I used w3schools to
brush up on some of the semantics of html and css. The password
is generated from the wisdom of xkcd.

##Other details worth noting
I generated a template style
navigation system so that files can be reused if necessary.
