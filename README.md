## Description
This is project 1 which is used to allow the TA's to navigate through
all of my projects I will complete in this course.  It contains
a link to each project as well as basic information about myself.

## Details for teaching team
No login required
Nothing special here

##Outside code
There are no external libraries or packages.  I used w3schools to
brush up on some of the semantics of html and css.
